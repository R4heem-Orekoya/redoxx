Hey! I'm Raheem, a full-stack developer from Nigeria with a passion for coding and mathematics. I specialize in backend development using Node.js and Express, but I'm also proficient in frontend technologies like React and Next.js. This allows me to tackle projects from start to finish with a comprehensive understanding of both client-side and server-side development.

I've honed my skills through continuous learning, coding projects, and tackling complex mathematical problems. I'm currently seeking new opportunities to leverage my technical expertise and contribute to innovative projects.

If you're looking for a skilled developer with a strong foundation in both backend and frontend development and a passion for problem-solving, let's connect!
